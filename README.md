### telegram trade bot

a telegram bot for me to control trading scripts from a private chat.

#### commands

- `/buy <coin> <price> <prc>` — starts buy script  
- `/sell <coin> <price> <prc>` — starts sell script  
- `/stopbuy` — stops the buy script  
- `/stopsell` — stops the sell script  

#### how it works

- each command sends a message to a `tmux` session running go executables  
- profit is calculated based on my algo and subtracts 1.5% fees  
- bot is not public only works in authorized telegram chat tho im setting it to public for now

#### run

set your bot token and run:

```bash
export botToken=your_token
python3 bot.py
